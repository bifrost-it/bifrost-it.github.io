<p><em>ERIS</em> is responsible for in-house installation order tracking with optimized usability and reporting capabilities for CFUâ€™s Tools.
It should support the electrician installation task. It will not be a substitute for general order tracking with Fit4SIP. But It must be able to integrate the applications used by ESIP and automate the OE-COLS provisioning process.
<em>ERIS</em> gives the possibility to the CFUs to have the view on the orders that concern them. And eventually let them intervene in the installation process.
